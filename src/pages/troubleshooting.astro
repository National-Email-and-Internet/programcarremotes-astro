        Having trouble programming your key fob? Here are solutions to the most common problems.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Remote Won't Enter Programming Mode</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Check your timing</strong> - Most procedures require precise timing between steps</li>
        <li><strong>Door position</strong> - Make sure doors are in the correct position (open/closed) as specified</li>
        <li><strong>Key position</strong> - Ensure you're turning the key fully to each position</li>
        <li><strong>Try again</strong> - It often takes 2-3 attempts to get the timing right</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Remote Programmed But Doesn't Work</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Battery</strong> - Replace the remote battery with a fresh one</li>
        <li><strong>Compatibility</strong> - Verify the remote is compatible with your exact vehicle year/model</li>
        <li><strong>Range</strong> - Test while standing next to the vehicle</li>
        <li><strong>Re-program</strong> - Try the programming procedure again from the beginning</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Vehicle Doesn't Respond During Programming</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Battery voltage</strong> - Low car battery can prevent programming</li>
        <li><strong>Existing remotes</strong> - Some vehicles require an existing working remote</li>
        <li><strong>Professional required</strong> - Some vehicles need dealer/locksmith equipment</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Maximum Remotes Reached</h2>
      <p>
        Most vehicles can store 2-4 remotes. Programming a new remote may erase old ones. 
        Program all remotes you want to use in the same session.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Still Having Issues?</h2>
      <p>
        If self-programming isn't working, you may need professional assistance.
