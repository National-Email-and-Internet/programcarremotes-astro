Programming Instructions:

Take the key out of the 626’s ignition and verify that all of the Mazda’s doors are closed. Open the driver’s door. You should be sitting in the driver’s seat. Leave the driver’s door open. Put the Mazda’s key in the ignition. Turn it to On then to Off three times. Take the key out. Locate the black button on the edge of the door frame. Push this button thrice.

Push any same button on the remote twice to program it to the Mazda 626. You’ll hear a chime. This lets you know the procedure was successful.
