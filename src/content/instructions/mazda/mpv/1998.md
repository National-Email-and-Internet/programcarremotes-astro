**Programming Instructions:**  Note: Programming the 1996 to 1999 MPV Remote and the Millenia Remote is the same.

Sit in the MPV’s driver seat and open the door, and then close the driver’s door. Put the key inside the ignition and turn it to ON without starting the motor. Then turn it OFF and take the key out. Repeat this twice more for a total of three times. Open the driver’s door and close it three times. Push any of the buttons on the remote twice to program it to the vehicle. The remote is programmed to the Mazda MPV.
