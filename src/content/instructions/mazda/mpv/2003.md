Sit in the MPV’s driver seat and open the door. Push LOCK and then push UNLOCK on the door panel switch. Put the MPV”s key inside the ignition cylinder. Turn it to ON then OFF three times.

The car’s doors will lock. Push UNLOCK on the the key fob twice. The horn will chirp. The remote is programmed to the Mazda MPV.
