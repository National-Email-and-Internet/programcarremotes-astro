**Programming Instructions:**

Sit in the 6’s driver seat and open the door. Push LOCK and then push UNLOCK on the door panel switch. Put the 6’s key inside the ignition cylinder. Turn it to ON then OFF three times. Perform this within 10 seconds. Time is of the essence. If done too slowly, it will not work. Close and then open the door three times, stopping when it is open for the last time. The car’s doors will lock. Push UNLOCK on the the key fob twice. The horn will chirp. The remote is programmed to the Mazda 6.
