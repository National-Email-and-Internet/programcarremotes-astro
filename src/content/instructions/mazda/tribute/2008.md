**Programming Instructions:  Note: The programming procedure is identical for many Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles, as well as for the Mazda Tribute and Mazda B-Series truck.**

Sit in the Tribute’s driver’s seat. Put the key in the ignition. Turn the key from OFF to RUN at least 8 times within a 10 second window. NOTE: You must do this very quickly for it to work. If successful, you’ll hear the doors lock and unlock. This lets you know the system is ready to accept the remote. Push any button on the remote. The door locks will lock and unlock. The remote is programmed.
