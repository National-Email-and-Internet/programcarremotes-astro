Learn to **program the remote** to your **1996** ****Ford F150, F250, or F350**** without any help from the dealer. This includes the F150 Lariat and King Ranch or Superduty models.

The Ford F-Series lineup of trucks includes vehicles like the F150, F250, F350 and even F450. The base model F-Series trucks, such as the XL package or work truck package, usually don’t have power door locks or a keyless remote. However, if you step up to the XLT model or even the Lariat, you’ll find the F-Series comes standard with a remote key fob.

**Programming Instructions: Note: The programming procedure is identical for many Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles, as well as for the Mazda Tribute and Mazda B-Series truck.**

Sit in the truck’s driver’s seat. Put the key in the ignition. Turn the key from OFF to RUN at least 8 times within a 10 second window. NOTE: You must do this very quickly for it to work. If successful, you’ll hear the doors lock and unlock. This lets you know the system is ready to accept the remote. Push any button on the remote. The door locks will lock and unlock. The remote is programmed.
