A few notes before you begin:

-   It is important that you DON’T push down on the brake pedal at all while you are programming the car remotes.
-   You have to reprogram ALL your remotes at the same time (if you have one working remote and one non-working remote, you must reprogram BOTH of them or the original working remote will not work)

**Remote Programming Instructions:**

1.  Sit in the truck’s driver’s seat.
2.  Use the lock/unlock switch IN THE DOOR (not on the remote) and unlock all the doors
3.  Put the key in the ignition.
4.  Turn the key from OFF to RUN at least 8 times within a 10 second window. NOTE: You must do this very quickly for it to work.
5.  If successful, you’ll hear the doors lock and unlock. This lets you know the system is ready to accept the remote.
6.  Push any button on the remote. The door locks will lock and unlock letting you know that the remote has been programmed.
7.  For each additional remote, repeat step #6 and wait to hear the door locks lock and unlock
8.  When you have finished programming all your car remotes, simply turn the ignition OFF and the locks will one last time turn on and off signalling that the vehicle has exited programming mode
