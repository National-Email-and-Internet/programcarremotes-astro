To program the key fob for the **2005 Pontiac G6 including the GT and GXP models****,** the vehicle needs to be taken to an automotive locksmith with the right equipment or to a GM  Dealer – it isn’t possible to program this make/model year on your own.

NOTE: I think the going rate these days is $30- $50 and you will need to take the CAR and ALL THE REMOTES with you as the GM dealer or locksmith will have to hook up a computer right to your car and then reprogram all the remote key fobs at once.
