Learn to **program the remote** to your **1993 Pontiac Bonneville w**ithout any help from the dealer.

Programming Instructions: Note: This is the same for many GM vehicles.

Look beneath the driver’s side dash. You’ll see a programming connector with two rows of slots. Insert your jumper wire into the top right slot and the bottom left slot. This jumps the pins and activates the programming mode. You’ll hear the door locks cycle.

Push the “Lock” or “Unlock” button three times on the remote you wish to program rapidly. This programs the remote to the vehicle. Repeat for additional remotes.
