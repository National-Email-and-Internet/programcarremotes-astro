Learn to **program the remote** to your **2000 Pontiac Firebird** without any help from the dealer. This includes the **Trans Am** model.

\[smartads\] Programming Instructions: Note: This is the same for many GM vehicles.

Sit in the car’s driver’s seat.Turn the key off. Open the driver’s side fuse panel and take out the fuse marked “Radio.” Turn the key to on, and then back off, and then to on again. Do this within a five second window. You’ll hear the car’s doors lock and unlock.

Push and hold “Lock” and “Unlock” for 15 to 20 seconds, until the door locks sound again. Now the remote is programmed. Turn the key off and replace the “Radio” fuse. Test the remote to ensure it works.
