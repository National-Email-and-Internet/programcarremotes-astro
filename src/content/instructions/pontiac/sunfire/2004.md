Learn to **program the remote** to your **2004 Pontiac Sunfire w**ithout any help from the dealer.

Programming Instructions: Note: This is the same for many GM vehicles.

Open the trunk. Look in the left corner of the trunk. Find the programming connector. Grab your jumper wire. Insert each end of the wire into one of the terminal’s slots. The door locks now cycle. Push and hold “Lock” on the remote for about 18 seconds. The locks will cycle again, which lets you know the remote is synchronized to the vehicle.
