troubleshooting:
  - question: "Locks didn't cycle after 4th turn"
    answer: "The timing was off. You need to complete each ON→LOCK→OFF cycle within 5 seconds. Start over and try to be quicker with the sequence."
  - question: "New remote doesn't work after programming"
    answer: "Check the battery in the new remote — it may be dead or installed incorrectly. Make sure you pressed LOCK within 10 seconds of entering programming mode. Verify your remote is compatible with your specific Civic trim/year."
  - question: "My Civic has push-button start"
    answer: "Push-button start Civics with smart keys cannot be self-programmed. You'll need to visit a Honda dealer or an automotive locksmith with Honda HDS diagnostic equipment. Expect to pay $50-100 for programming."

## Before You Start

You must have at least one working key fob to program additional remotes. If you have no working keys, you'll need a locksmith with Honda diagnostic equipment.

## What You'll Need

- **One working programmed key fob** — your existing remote
- **New key fob(s) to program** — with fresh battery installed
- **5 uninterrupted minutes** — timing is important

## Test Your Key Fobs

After programming, exit the vehicle and close all doors. Test each programmed remote:

- ✓ Press LOCK — doors should lock, lights should flash
- ✓ Press UNLOCK — doors should unlock
- ✓ Press PANIC — horn should sound (press again to stop)
