Programming Instructions:

Note: Programming the remote is the same or similar for many Acura and Honda vehicles.

Sit in the Acura’s driver’s seat. Turn the key to position “2.” Push LOCK on the remote you plan on programming. Turn the key to position “0.” Turn the key back to position “2.”

Repeat the above procedure four more times.  Push LOCK on the same remote. The door locks now cycle. Push LOCK on the remote. Push LOCK on any other remotes you want to program. If you already had a remote programmed, and are programming an extra, push LOCK on it as well — it must be reprogrammed. Turn the key to position 0 and remove it to finish.
