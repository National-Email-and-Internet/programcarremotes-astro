**Programming Instructions:**

To program the key fob for the **2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee,** you will have to take the vehicle to an automotive locksmith with the right equipment or to a real Jeep Dealer – it isn’t possible to program this make/model year on your own.

NOTE: you will need to take the CAR and ALL THE REMOTES with you as the Chevy dealer or locksmith will have to hook up a computer right to your car and then reprogram all the remote key fobs at once.
