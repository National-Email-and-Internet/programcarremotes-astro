Programming Instructions:  
Note: Programming the remote requires the dealer if you have iDrive or the Smart Key.

Sit in the car’s driver’s seat. Verify that each of the vehicle’s doors, including the trunk, are closed. Insert the key straight into the ignition. Turn it to 1 and then back to OFF five times. Take the key out. Push and hold UNLOCK. While holding UNLOCK, press LOCK three times. Let go of the UNLOCK button. Congratulations, the key fob is programmed to the car.
