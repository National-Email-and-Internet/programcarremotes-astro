**Programming Instructions:** 

1\. Take the key out of the ignition and close all of the doors (while sitting inside).

2\. Open the driver’s side door (keep it open until step 4).

3\. Insert the key. Turn it to “On”, then Turn it to “off” and Remove it.

4\. Close then open the driver’s door three times within 10 seconds.

5\. Insert the key and turn it to “On”, then Turn it to ‘Off’ and then Remove it.

6\. If the car has entered programming mode successfully  the door locks should lock and then unlock on their own. If this does not happen, then the car is not in programming mode and you should start again.

7\. Push “Unlock” on the remote and the door locks should again lock and unlock, confirming that the key fob has been programmed.

If you are programming more than one remote, simply repeat step 7 and when completed, exit the car, close the door and test the remotes.
