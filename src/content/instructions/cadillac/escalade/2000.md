Programming Instructions:

Sit in the driver’s seat. Press and hold the door lock button on the door pad. Continue to hold it. Insert the key. Turn it from off to on, back to off, and then back to on again rapidly. Let go of the door lock button. The horn will chirp. Push and hold “Lock” and “Unlock” on the remote fob for 30 seconds. The horn will chirp again. This lets you know the remote fob is programmed.
