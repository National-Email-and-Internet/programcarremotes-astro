**Programming Instructions:**

You can’t program the 2005 Chevy Cobalt yourself – you will have to take the car to a Chevy Dealer or an automotive locksmith in order to have it programmed. I recommend trying an automotive locksmith first as they can be faster and less expensive.

NOTE: you will need to take the CAR and ALL THE REMOTES with you as the locksmith will have to hook up a computer right to your car and then reprogram all the remotes at once.
