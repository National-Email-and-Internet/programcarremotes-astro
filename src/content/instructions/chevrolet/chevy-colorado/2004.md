Learn to **program the remote** to your **2004 Chevy Colorado** without any help from the dealer.

The Chevy Colorado came out in 2004, taking the place of the long produced S10 truck in the Chevrolet truck lineup. The Colorado is larger than the S10. Althought the Colorado is well equippped, base models do not include power door locks, and thus, do not include a remote key fob.

Programming Instructions:

Note: This is the same for many GM vehicles.

Sit in the driver’s seat. Insert the key into the ignition but don’t turn it. Push and hold the “Lock” button on the door. Continue to hold it. Turn the key to on, off, and then back to on, rapidly. Release the “Lock” button. The doors will sound. The remote is ready to be programmed. Push and hold “Unlock” and “Lock” on the remote for 20 seconds. The remote is programmed to the vehicle.
