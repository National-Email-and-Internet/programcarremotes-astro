Programming Instructions:

Note: This is the same for many GM vehicles.

Sit in the car’s driver’s seat. Insert the key and turn it ON. Push the INFORMATION button on the information center until the display reads PRESS TO RELEARN KEYS. Push the CHECK button. Push and hold LOCK and UNLOCK on the remote. Wait about 15 seconds or so. You’ll hear the horn chirp. The remote is programmed. Repeat for the additional remotes you need to program; you can program up to 8.
