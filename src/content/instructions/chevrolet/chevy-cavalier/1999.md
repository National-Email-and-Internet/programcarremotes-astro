Programming Instructions:

Note: This is the same for many GM vehicles.

Open the trunk. Find the jump pin connection on the driver’s side of the trunk. Jump the pins by inserting each end of your jumper wire into the appropriate jumping hole. You’ll hear the Cavalier’s locks sound. Push any remote button, such as “Lock.” You’ll hear a sound. The remote is programmed to the vehicle.
