Programming Instructions:

You can’t program the **2005 Chevrolet Equinox on your own** (unless you have access to a Tech 2 Scan tool) – the only alternatives are to find an automotive locksmith with the right equipment or take your car to an actual Chevrolet Dealer.

NOTE: you will need to take the CAR and ALL THE REMOTES with you as the Chevy dealer or locksmith will have to hook up a computer right to your car and then reprogram all the remote key fobs at once.
