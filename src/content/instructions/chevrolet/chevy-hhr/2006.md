Programming Instructions:

Unfortunately, this car cannot be programmed without a scanner. To have your keyless entry fob’s programmed you will have to visit either the dealership or an automotive locksmith.

I recommend checking out the automotive locksmith first as they can be faster and less expensive than the dealer route.

NOTE: call ahead to make sure they can do it for your make/model/year

NOTE: no matter where you go, make sure you take all your remote entry key fobs with you (even the working ones) because they all have to be done at once.
