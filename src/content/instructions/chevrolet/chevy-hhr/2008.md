Programming Instructions:

Note:  You will need a Scanner to program the 2008 Chevy HHR key fob. If you do not have access to a scan tool, you will need to take your vehicle and ALL keys to a Chevy Dealer who will program it for you at an approximate cost of a half hour of shop time or to an automotive locksmith.

If you have access to a scan tool, then the instructions are as follows:

**Important Notes:**

1.  **Up to 4 transmitters can be programmed.**
2.  **Do not operate or program the transmitters in the vicinity of other vehicles that are in the keyless entry program mode. This prevents the programming of the transmitters to the incorrect vehicle.**
3.  **The order in which the transmitters are programmed is important.** **The first transmitter programmed will be transmitter #1, and the second transmitter programmed will be transmitter #2.**
4.  **Use care to program the transmitters correctly.**
5.  **The scan tool must stay connected until all of the transmitters are programmed.**

This procedure will erase all **keyless entry transmitters** from memory.

-   Install a scan tool.
-   Turn ON the ignition with the engine OFF.
-   With the scan tool, select Body.
-   Select Remote Control Door Lock Receiver (RCDLR).
-   Select Module Setup.
-   Select Program Key Fobs.
-   Select Invalidate All.
-   Follow the scan tool on screen instructions.

**Next Available Slot**

Incremental programming allows for a transmitter to be programmed into the next available location without affecting the currently programmed transmitters. Previously programmed transmitters will not be erased during this procedure.

**Important:** **If all 4 slots are programmed, the Invalidate All procedure will need to be performed to allow transmitter programming.**
