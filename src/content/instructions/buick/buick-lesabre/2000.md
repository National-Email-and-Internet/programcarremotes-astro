Programming Instructions: \[smartads\]

Turn the Lesabre’s key to OFF. Leave it in the ignition. Open the driver’s door. Find the OBD data port on the left side of the dash, beneath the steering wheel. Insert a jumper pin into pins 8 and 4. The doors will lock and unlock. Close the driver’s door. Turn the ignition key to ON. Wait a few seconds, and then push and hold LOCK and UNLOCK on the key fob you are programming. Wait for the doors to unlock and lock. This takes about a minute. The remote is programmed.
