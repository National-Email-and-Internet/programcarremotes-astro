Programming Instructions:

Find the car’s data programming port. This is located in the trunk. It’s a white connector with 16 holes. Put the key in the ignition. Leave it in the “Off” position. Put the jumper wire pin into data port slot four. Put the other end of the pin into data port one. The door  locks will cycle. Turn the key to “On,” and then back to off. Repeat this ignition cycle twice more quickly.

Push “Lock” on the remote three times within 10 seconds. The horn will sound when the system accepts the remote.
