Programming Instructions:

Find the car’s data programming port.**Locate the Data Port under drivers side dashboard usually located to the right of steering column.**

It’s a white connector with 16 holes. Put the key in the ignition. Leave it in the “Off” position. Put the jumper wire pin into data port slot four. Put the other end of the pin into data port one.

The door  locks will cycle – you are now in programming mode  \[you may have to press the hazard switch 6 times to make the door locks cycle, there are mixed reports on whether you need to do that or not\].

Take the remote you want to program and WITHIN 10 seconds, press the LOCK  button three times – the door locks should cycle on and off again.

You can repeat this for each remote you want to program up to a total of four remotes as long as you do it within one minute.

When you are done, simply remove the jumper wire from the data port and remove the keys from the ignition. Thats it!
