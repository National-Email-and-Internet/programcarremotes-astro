2.  Turn the key to the ON position “2.”
3.  Push LOCK on the remote you plan on programming (if you are having difficulty, try pointing the key fob under the stereo.
4.  Turn the key to the OFF position “0.”
5.  Turn the key back to the ON position “2.”
6.  Repeat steps 3, 4 and 5 twice more (a total of three times)
7.  Push LOCK on the same remote.
8.  The door locks should now cycle, indicating that the remote has been programmed.
9.  Push LOCK on any other remotes you want to program. The door locks will cycle after each remote is programmed
10.   When done, turn the key to the OFF position “0” and remove it to finish.
