How to program the 2003 Saturn Ion remote keyless entry:

**Programming Instructions:** 

This remote cannot be programmed to the vehicle without the assistance of a dealer. You’ll need to visit the dealer so he can connect the system to the programming software to program the remote for you. Expect this to cost $35 to $50. If the dealer tries to pay more, take the car to another dealer.
