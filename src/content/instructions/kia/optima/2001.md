Programming Instructions:

This vehicle does not have a customer programmable keyless entry system. In all cases, you’ll need to have the dealer to program the remote for you. The dealer has a special Kia software scan tool which allows him to program new remotes to the vehicle. Expect this procedure to cost anywhere from $35 to $50. If the dealer tries to charge more, consider visiting a different dealer.
